>  21. Jesus Drives Out an Evil Spirit<br/>They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. 22. The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.

>  23. Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out, 24. “What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” 25. “Be quiet!” said Jesus sternly. “Come out of him!” 26. The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. 27. The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.”

Jesus thought in a new way because he had insider knowlage because he wrote the book
jesus has
Authority over nature
athourity over teaching
authority over deamons
>  [Mark 1:28-31 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/41/1/)
>  28. News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee. 29. Jesus Heals Many<br/>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. 30. Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her. 31. So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.

the dug up what we thought is peters hours in caperneam. Also peter is married and has a mother  in law he like enought to have jesus heal her

>  32. That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. 33. The whole town gathered at the door, 34. and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.

>  [Mark 1:35-38 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/41/1/)
>  35. Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place<br/>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. 36. Simon and his companions went to look for him, 37. and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!” 38. Jesus replied, “Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.”

when we get budsy jesus becomes our last priority not our first
(idk how they found him, there was no life 360 then)
jesus was paced by purpose not preassure
- joshiah found the law because they lost it in chasing affter other things like that nation we move through life pressured by work, school,sports, that we forget to spend time with God and we lose our way in life
- Quotes on prayer
- "I would rather teach one man to pray than ten men to preach"-Charles Spurgeon "He who kneels the most, stands the best."- D.L. Moody
- "Every great movement of God can be traced to a kneeling figure."-D.L. Moody
- "Relying on God has to begin all over again zery day as if nothing had yet been done."- C.S.Lewis
- "I have so much to do that I shall spend the first three hours in prayer."-Martin Luther

Do you live your life like you know jesus? Following Jesus requires us to prioritize what jesus prioritized.
He (jesus) is the vine and we are the branches
Mark 1:39-43
He was 100% God and 100% man and he took breacks to spend time with his God.
- somtimes the most spiritual thing you can do is take a nap -pator mark et al to jason
Action steps
1. Write down your weekly schedule 
- start with what you have to do, then what you want to do. Doing this you can see where your priorities lie.
2. Carve out 15 minutes a day to consistently spend time with jesus
- be intentional and dogmatic with these 15 minutes with God; your kids and spose and sleep can wait. 
Everyone has 15 minutes, find then and take one step.

We should be so thankful that our savior does not tell us to run untill we drop, but tells us to rest.
