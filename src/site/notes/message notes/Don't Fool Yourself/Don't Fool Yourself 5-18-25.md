Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. 22. Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 23.

But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it—he will be blessed in what he does. 26. If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. 27. Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

Look after those who are vulnerable within your church.
Even though we are followers of Jesus there is a constant battle to keep ourselves "unstained" From the world.

Don't give up the battle.
