*The context*
> [!bible] [James 1:18-27 - BBE](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1:18-27&version=bbe)
> 18. Of his purpose he gave us being, by his true word, so that we might be, in a sense, the first-fruits of all the things which he had made.
> 19. You have knowledge of this, dear brothers. But let every man be quick in hearing, slow in words, slow to get angry;
> 20. For the righteousness of God does not come about by the wrath of man.
> 21. For this reason, putting away all dirty behaviour and the overweight of evil, take into your souls without pride the word which, being planted there, is able to give you salvation.
> 22. But be doers of the word, and not only hearers of it, blinding yourselves with false ideas.
> 23. Because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a glass;
> 24. For after looking at himself he goes away, and in a short time he has no memory of what he was like.
> 25. But he who goes on looking into the true law which makes him free, being not a hearer without memory but a doer putting it into effect, this man will have a blessing on his acts.
> 26. If a man seems to have religion and has no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false, this man's religion is of no value.
> 27. The religion which is holy and free from evil in the eyes of our God and Father is this: to take care of children who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble, and to keep oneself untouched by the world.

“Be doers of the world.” To experience change you must do 
  ^ Allow God's word to reshape ypu
  James is concerned that his veiwers were content to just listen to the word.
  substituting relegius knowlege for lived obedance.
  just listeing and learning is living hypocoracy.
   we fall into this same trap now.
   * God did not give us the bible for information he gave us the bible to be transformed
   ** Moral lenancy is another reason we fall into "hearing only" AKA vertjue signaling
   we want to be followers of jesus without having our lives reordered
.
Being informed about the bible does not mean anything
"knowledge without application is like having a prescription without taking the medicine"
the mirror is scripture; but the mirror cannot clean your face by itself
*the scripture reveals our need.
- look intently, meditate on what you need.
- perfect love of freedom, true freedom is not the absence of boundary, but living in accordance to our design
- persistency, we have spiritual ADD. Real transformation is consistency overtime.

> Spiritual growth requires persistent application of biblical truth

#### Action Steps
> Ask
> - where is the gap between my knowledge and my practice?
> - what would the people who know me say about the consistency between my beliefs and my behavior?

### Bottom Line
Following Jesus is walking where Jesus walked; not just studying it.
*What will you do to move from hearing to doing?*
