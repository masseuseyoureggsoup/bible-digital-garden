>  [James 1:19-21 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/59/1/)
>  19. Listening and Doing<br/>My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, 20. for manâ€™s anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. 21. Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.

Remove what blocks transformation, embrace what causes transformation
> repentance is the reasonability of the believer, it is a choice

>  [Colossians 3:8-10 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/51/3/)
>  8. But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. 9. Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices 10. and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.

>  [1 Peter 2:1-2 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/60/2/)
>  1. Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind. 2. Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,

>  [Hebrews 12:1-2 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/58/12/)
>  1. God Disciplines His Sons<br/>Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. 2. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

moral filth will impede our ability to hear 
Anger flows from a filthy heart
> anger is a secondary emotion to rid of anger you must rid yourself from
    residual hurt
    impossible expectations
    etc.
Remove these things so that you can humbly receive the word of God

The word of truth is referred to in every other sentence of James, this refers not only to the teachings of Jesus, but to the letters in all the bible, for it all is the word of God!
like a seed it is the implanted word that makes us grow
Anger is overcome by a heart transformed by the word of God.
