Recap time — receive trials with pure joy and let endurance work. Do this, and you lack nothing. However, we lack wisdom; pray for it every day.

## Trials of Resources 

There are different trials for the rich and the poor

> [!bible] [1 Timothy 6:17-19 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/54/6/)
> 17. As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
> 18. They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,
> 19. thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.



> How to address the wealthy 

> [!bible] [James 1:17-19 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/59/1/)
> 17. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.
> 18. Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
> 19. Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger;



> The poor believe that the rich are favored by God

> [!bible] [Matthew 19:23-35 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/40/19/)
> 23. And Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven.
> 24. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”
> 25. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?”
> 26. But Jesus looked at them and said,  “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
> 27. Then Peter said in reply, “See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?”
> 28. Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, in the new world,  when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
> 29. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold  and will inherit eternal life.
> 30. But many who are first will be last, and the last first.



> Wealth can keep you out of heaven

> [!bible] [James 1:9-10 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/59/1/)
> 9. Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation,
> 10. and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass  he will pass away.



>Everyone struggles with money. It's not that wealth is brief; but that life is brief.

> [!bible] [James 1:12 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/59/1/)
> 12. Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him.



> Blessed is the one who endure trials for they will receive the crown of life
