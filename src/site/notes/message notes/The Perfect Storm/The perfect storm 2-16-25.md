### Job 1:13-21

> [!bible] [Job 1:13-21 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/18/1/)
> 13. Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
> 14. and there came a messenger to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,
> 15. and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them and struck down the servants  with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
> 16. While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
> 17. While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, “The Chaldeans formed three groups and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
> 18. While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
> 19. and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
> 20. Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground and worshiped.
> 21. And he said, “Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.”



* The Lord gives, the Lord takes away. Blessed is the Lord. Job's noble joyful acceptance.

God's will is our only good.

### James 1: 5-8

> [!bible] [James 1:5-8 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/59/1/)
> 5. If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.
> 6. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.
> 7. For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;
> 8. he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.




* We lack wisdom: consistently and ask God for wisdom.

* Wisdom is the application of knowledge 

- ask God for his wisdom to remain in his will 

### Hebrew 11:6

> [!bible] [Hebrews 11:6 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/58/11/)
> 6. And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.




Wisdom from God enables us to triumph over our trials
