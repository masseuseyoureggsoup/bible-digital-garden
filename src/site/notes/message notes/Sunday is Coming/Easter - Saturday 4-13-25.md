## Psalms 13: 1-2

- Saturday is the day where the worst happens

> the day of prayer and survival mode

- So, what do?
    - There is a way that doesn't lead to darkness

### Let's start from Friday

- Matthew 27
    - noon-3pm
- John 19: 28-42
- Luke 23: 44-56
- John 19: 28-42

#### John > royal burial protocol

#### Luke

> this is how Friday ends, and they restart on the sabbath according to the commandments and this was Saturday

#### In the middle of their darkest moments, they chose to honor God

# Bottom line:

```gauss
In your darkest moments, make God-honoring choices 
```

- 1 Corinthians 15:3-4

According to the scriptures

- Third day stories

> Abraham and Issac

> Joseph's brothers

> Rahab and the spies

> ethers intercession

> - Hosea 6:1-2

> - romans 8:28

- psalms 30:5
    
    ## God does his greatest work in the worst of times
    

In histories darkest hour, Death was undone

##### Action step

- Ask how can i honor God today?
